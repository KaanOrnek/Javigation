By default, PX4 uses commonly established UDP ports for MAVLink communication with ground control stations (e.g. QGroundControl), Offboard APIs (e.g. Dronecode SDK, MAVROS) and simulator APIs (e.g. Gazebo). These ports are:

UDP Port 14540 is used for communication with offboard APIs. Offboard APIs are expected to listen for connections on this port.
UDP Port 14550 is used for communication with ground control stations. GCS are expected to listen for connections on this port. QGroundControl listens to this port by default.
TCP Port 4560 is used for communication with simulators. PX4 listens to this port, and simulators are expected to initiate the communication by broadcasting data to this port.
